### How to use

You need to provide two form-data parameters in a Multipart Formdata request.
Use curl for that please. An example follows bellow.

#### filename
* this is the where you load your image file in

#### commands
* this is where you set your commands. there are only two examples at the moment:

1. Kuwahara filter:

> It smooths the image

2. Image contour filter:

> Processes differences in color ranges

> These requests you can apply as many times as you like using a JSON request. Read following example for more.

### Command example

```
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "filter": "imageKuwahara",
      "settings": [
        {
          "name": "square-size",
          "value": "2"
        },
        {
          "name": "iterations",
          "value": "2"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "filter": "imageContour",
      "settings": [
        {
          "name": "bgColor",
          "value": "0xFFFFFF"
        },
        {
          "name": "lnColor",
          "value": "0x000000"
        },
        {
          "name": "diffThreshold",
          "value": "800000"
        },
        {
          "name": "radius",
          "value": "2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Complete request

You can use tools like postman, but you can also use curl. This is an example of such request:
```
$ curl -X POST --form filename=@testEye.png http://localhost:8080/images --form commands="{ \"commands\": [ { \"filter\": \"imageKuwahara\", \"settings\": [ { \"name\": \"square-size\", \"value\": \"2\"}, { \"name\": \"iterations\", \"value\": \"2\"} ]}, { \"filter\": \"imageContour\", \"settings\": [ { \"name\": \"bgColor\", \"value\": \"0xFFFFFF\"}, { \"name\": \"lnColor\", \"value\": \"0x000000\"}, { \"name\": \"diffThreshold\", \"value\": \"800000\"}, { \"name\": \"radius\", \"value\": \"2\"} ]} ] }"
```

### Results

Your results are stored wherever you define in your application.conf folder:

```
akka {
  loglevel = DEBUG
  event-handlers = ["akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jEventHandler"]
}

service {
  host = "localhost"
  port = 8080
}

image-train-filters {
  image-source-path = "/tmp/image-train-filters/sources"
  image-destination-path = "/tmp/image-train-filters/destination"
}
```

Only important to note here that:

* image-source-path -> This is where your original file is saved

* image-destination-path -> This is where the resulting file is saved after applying the train of filters.
